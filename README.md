### Content
This repository contains a framework for SERO based super-resolution reconstruction, i.e. reconstructing high resolution parameter maps directly from low-resolution signals. It contains a pipeline for both pulse sequence generation for pulse sequences compatible with SERO, and a super-resolution reconstrution pipeline.
